# The Odin Project 4 - odin-etch-a-sketch

This is the fourth project from The Odin Project curriculum.

It is a in-browser sketchpad.

It was created using:

- HTML
- CSS
- plain JavaScript

# How this project works

At first you will see a blank sketchpad witch two inputs and two buttons:

- number input (1 - 100)
- **Generate** button
- color input
- **Reset** button
- Painting Control (when painting is enabled it will have limeGreen background)

Before you begin you have to enter the number of grid squares per wall and click the **Generate** button.

Now when grid is generated you can pick a color from RGB palette and draw something.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default painting is set to false, you have to click the grid regardless of whether you want to enable or disable painting.

If you want to reset all squares back to white color, you can simply click **Reset** button.
